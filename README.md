# RGN2

This is the reference implementation of recurrent geometric network-2 (RGN2), described in the paper [Single-sequence protein structure prediction using a language model and deep learning]

* Python 3
* TensorFlow 1.14
* setproctitle

### Note: We recommend using RGN2 primarily for prediction of orphan or de novo proteins. For proteins with known homologs we suggest using AlphaFold2 or OpenFold.
#### AlphaFold2 Colab:https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb
#### OpenFold Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/aqlaboratory/openfold/blob/main/notebooks/OpenFold.ipynb

## Usage
Open the rgn2_prediction.ipynb and paste your helical orphan protein sequence and follow the steps therein to predict the 3D structure.
