# RGN2

This is the reference implementation of recurrent geometric network-2 (RGN2), described in the paper _Single-sequence protein structure prediction using a language model and deep learning_.

**Note:** We recommend using RGN2 primarily for prediction of orphan or de novo proteins. For proteins with known homologs we suggest using
[AlphaFold2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb) or 
[OpenFold](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aqlaboratory/openfold/blob/main/notebooks/OpenFold.ipynb).

## Usage
Use the [RGN2 Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aqlaboratory/rgn2/blob/master/rgn2_prediction.ipynb) to predict the 3D structures for orphan or de novo protein sequences.
